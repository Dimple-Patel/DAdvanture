This is practice project which I have developed to learn REST API and web application using Node.js.
In this project I used various concepts and fetaures of Node.js and MongoDB like,
- Node package manager(NPM),fundamentals of Node.js
- Fundamentals of Express such as routing,middleware,sending responses etc..
- RESTful API design with filtering,sorting,aliasing and pagination
- ServerSide website rendering with Pug templates
- CRUD operation,geospatial queries,aggregation pipeline,operators,relationships between collection,embedding,referencing etc.. with MongoDB database
- Data models,CRUD operation,data validation,middleware,populates,virtual populates,indexes etc.. with Mongoose
- Use Model-view-controller(MVC) architecture.
- Authentication with JWT:sign up,log in,password reset,secure cookies etc..
- Authorization using user roles
- Security :encryption, sanitization, rate limiting, etc.
- Payment on back-end and front-end side using Stripe
- Upload files and process images
